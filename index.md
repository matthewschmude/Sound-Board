## What this is
This is a sound board application built in windows forms. It outputs audio through two selected audio out devices as to allow for the sound to be heard through the application using the sound device and the user themself (through their own local device). This was made to get around all of the unnecessary hoops that downloading a sound board comes with. This project provides a simple and clear way to import, store, and play sounds all at the expense of a 10 mb download. 

### Dependencies
With over 100 integrated dependencies, the simple to use installer, found in Setup/Release, installs all necessary files imperative to the speed and usage of this product. This build allows for quick and simple navigation to the sound board itself. Finally, this is only needed to be run once, as 'Soundboard.exe' found in the downloaded project folder is the only file (along with the installed dependencies) needed to run the application.
